INSERT INTO wocka VALUES ('I think Santa Claus is a woman... I hate to be the one to defy sacred myth, but I believe he''s a she. Think about it. Christmas is a big, organized, warm, fuzzy, nurturing social deal, and I have a tough time believing a guy could possibly pull it all off! <br /><br>For starters, the vast majority of men don''t even think about selecting gifts until Christmas Eve. It''s as if they are all frozen in some kind of ebenezerian Time Warp until 3 p.m. on Dec. 24th, when they - with amazing calm - call other errant men and plan for a last-minute shopping spree. Once at the mall, they always seem surprised to find only Ronco products, socket wrench sets, and mood rings left on the shelves. You might think this would send them into a fit of panic and guilt, but my husband tells me it''s an enormous relief because it lessens the 11th hour decision-making burden. On this count alone, I''m convinced Santa is a woman. Surely, if he were a man, everyone in the universe would wake up Christmas morning to find a rotating, musical Chia Pet under the tree, still in the bag. <br /><br><br /><br>Another problem for a he-Santa would be getting there. First of all, there would be no reindeer because they would all be dead, gutted, and strapped onto the rear bumper of the sleigh amid wide-eyed, desperate claims that buck season had been extended. Blitzen''s rack would already be on the way to the taxidermist. <br /><br><br /><br>Even if the male Santa DID have reindeer, he''d still have transportation problems because he would inevitably get lost up there in the snow and clouds and then refuse to stop and ask for directions. Add to this the fact that there would be unavoidable delays in the chimney, where the Bob Vila-like Santa would stop to inspect and repoint bricks in the flue. He would also need to check for carbon monoxide fumes in every gas fireplace, and get under every Christmas tree that is crooked to straighten it to a perfectly upright 90-degree angle. <br /><br><br /><br>Other reasons why Santa can''t possibly be a man: <br /><br><br /><br>* Men can''t pack a bag.<br /><br>* Men would rather be dead than caught wearing red velvet.<br /><br>* Men would feel their masculinity is threatened... having to be seen with all those elves.<br /><br>* Men don''t answer their mail.<br /><br>* Men would refuse to allow their physique to be described even in jest as anything remotely resembling a "bowlful of jelly."<br /><br>* Men aren''t interested in stockings unless somebody''s wearing them.<br /><br>* Having to do the Ho Ho Ho thing would seriously inhibit their ability to pick up women.<br /><br>* Finally, being responsible for Christmas would require a commitment. <br /><br><br /><br>I can buy the fact that other mythical characters are men... Father Time shows up once a year unshaven and looking ominous. Definite guy. Cupid flies around carrying weapons. Uncle Sam is a politician who likes to point fingers. Any one of these individuals could pass the testosterone-screening test. But not St. Nick. Not a chance. However, as long as we have each other, good will, peace on earth, faith and Nat King Cole''s version of "The Christmas Song," it probably makes little difference what gender Santa is.

Compaq is considering changing the command "Press Any Key" to "Press Return Key" because of the flood of calls asking where the "Any" key is.<br /><br><br /><br>    2. AST technical support had a caller complaining that her mouse was hard to control with the dust cover on. The cover turned out to be the plastic bag the mouse was packaged in.<br /><br><br /><br>    3. Another Compaq technician received a call from a man complaining that the system wouldn''t read word processing files from his old diskettes. After trouble-shooting for magnets and heat failed to diagnose the problem, it was found that the customer had labeled the diskettes, then rolled them into the typewriter to type the labels.<br /><br><br /><br>    4. Another AST customer was asked to send a copy of her defective diskettes. A few days later a letter arrived from the customer along with photocopies of the floppies.<br /><br><br /><br>    5. A Dell technician advised his customer to put his troubled floppy back in the drive and close the door. The customer asked the tech to hold on, and was heard putting the phone down, getting up and crossing the room to close the door to his room.<br /><br><br /><br>    6. Another Dell customer called to say he couldn''t get his computer to fax anything. After 40 minutes of trouble-shooting, the technician discovered the man was trying to fax a piece of paper by holding it in front of the monitor screen and hitting the "send" key.<br /><br><br /><br>    7. Yet another Dell customer called to complain that his keyboard no longer worked. He had cleaned it by filling up his tub with soap and water and soaking the keyboard for a day, then removing all the keys and washing them individually.<br /><br><br /><br>    8. A Dell technician received a call from a customer who was enraged because his computer had told him he was "bad and an invalid". The tech explained that the computer''s "bad command" and "invalid" responses shouldn''t be taken personally.<br /><br><br /><br>    9. A confused caller to IBM was having troubles printing documents. He told the technician that the computer had said it "couldn''t find printer". The user had also tried turning the computer screen to face the printer - but that his computer still couldn''t "see" the printer.<br /><br><br /><br>    10. An exasperated caller to Dell Computer Tech Support couldn''t get her new Dell Computer to turn on. After ensuring the computer was plugged in, the technician asked her what happened when she pushed the power button. Her response, "I pushed and pushed on this foot pedal and nothing happens." The "foot pedal" turned out to be the computer''s mouse.<br /><br><br /><br>    11. Another customer called Compaq tech support to say her brand-new computer wouldn''t  work. She said she unpacked the unit, plugged it in and sat there for 20 minutes waiting for something to happen. When asked what happened when she pressed the power switch, she asked "What power switch?"<br /><br><br /><br>    12.

Does it   have any trademark on it?"<br /><br>Caller: "It came with my computer, I don''t know anything about a promotional. It just has ''4X'' on it." At this point the Tech Rep had to mute the caller, because he couldn''t stand it. He was laughing too hard. The caller had been using the load drawer of the CD-ROM drive as a cup holder, and snapped it off the drive!<br /><br><br /><br>    13. Another IBM customer had troubles installing software and rang for support. "I put in the first disk, and that was OK. It said to put in the second disk, and had some problems with the disk.

INSERT INTO wocka VALUES ('Once upon a time there lived a woman in Brampton who had a maddening passion for baked beans. She loved them, but unfortunately they always gave her a very embarrassing, and somewhat lively reaction. When it became apparent that she and her boyfriend would marry she thought to herself, "He is such a sweet and gentle man but I don''t think he can live with my problems." So she decided to make the supreme sacrifice and give up beans. <br /><br>A year later her car broke down on the way home from work. Since she lived in the country, she called her husband and told him she would be late because she had to walk home. On her way, she passed a small diner and the odor of the baked beans was more than she could stand. Since she still had miles to walk, she figured that she could walk off any ill effect by the time she reached home. So she stopped at the diner, and before she knew it she had consumed three large orders of baked beans. All the way home she putt-putted. <br /><br><br /><br>Upon arriving home she felt reasonably sure she could control it. Her husband seemed excited to see her, exclaming delightedly, "Darling, I have a surprise for dinner tonight." He then blindfolded her then led her to a chair at the table. Just as he was about to remove the blindfold the phone rang. He made her promise not to touch the blindfold till he came back, then he went to answer the phone. <br /><br><br /><br>The baked beans she had consumed were still affecting her and the pressure was becoming almost unbearable, so while her husband was out of the room she seized the opportunity, shifted the weight to one leg, and let it go. It was not only loud, but it smelt like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk coming from a pulp mill. She took a napkin and fanned the air around her vigorously. Then she shifted to the other cheek and ripped three more, which reminded her of cabbage cooking. Keeping her ears turned to the conversation in the other room, she went on like this for another ten minutes. When the phone farewells signed the end of her freedom, she fanned the air a few more times with the napkin, placed it on her lap and folded her hands upon it, smiling contentedly to herself, she was the picture of innocence when her husband returned. Apologizing for taking so long, he asked her if she peeked and she assured him that she had not. At this point, he removes the blindfold to reveal twelve dinner guests seated around the table to wish her a first Happy Anniversary!','Gross',126,'Gas');

I gave the problem some serious thought and came up with a solution:<br /><br><br /><br>First, I had my phone dial Jackass #1.<br /><br>A man answered nicely saying, "Hello." <br /><br><br /><br>I yelled "You''re a jackass!" but I didn''t hang up.<br /><br><br /><br>The jackass said, "Are you still there?"<br /><br><br /><br>I said, "Yeah."<br /><br><br /><br>He said, "Stop calling me."<br /><br><br /><br>I said, "No."<br /><br><br /><br>He said, "What''s you name, pal?"<br /><br><br /><br>I said, "Don Hansen."<br /><br><br /><br>He said, "Where do you live?"<br /><br><br /><br>"1802 West 34th Street. It''s a yellow house and my black Camaro''s parked out front."<br /><br><br /><br>"I''m coming over right now, Don. You''d better start saying your prayers."<br /><br><br /><br>"Yeah, like I''m really scared, Jackass!" and I hung up.<br /><br><br /><br>Then I called Jackass #2. He answered, "Hello."<br /><br><br /><br>I said, "Hello, Jackass!"<br /><br><br /><br>He said, "If I ever find out who you are..."<br /><br><br /><br>"You''ll what?"<br /><br><br /><br>"I''ll kick your butt."<br /><br><br /><br>"Well, here''s your chance. I''m coming over right now, Jackass!" And I hung up.<br /><br><br /><br>Then I picked up the phone and called the police. I told them I was at 1802 West 34th Street and that I was going to kill my gay lover as soon as he got home.<br /><br><br /><br>Another quick call to Channel 13 about the gang war going on down W. 34th Street.<br /><br><br /><br>After that, I climbed into my car and headed over to 34th Street to watch the whole thing.

INSERT INTO wocka VALUES ('Proof That Santa Doesn''t Exist - For Nerds!  <br /><br><br /><br>There are approximately two billion children (persons under 18) in the world. However, since Santa does not visit children of Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, or Buddhist (except maybe in Japan) religions, this reduces the workload for Christmas night to 15% of the total, or 378 million (according to the population reference bureau). At an average (census) rate of 3.5 children per household, that comes to 108 million homes, presuming there is at least one good child in each. <br /><br>Santa has about 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming east to west (which seems logical). This works out to 967.7 visits per second. This is to say that for each Christian household with a good child, Santa has around 1/1000th of a second to park the sleigh, hop out, jump down the chimney, fill the stockings, distribute the remaining presents under the tree, eat whatever snacks have been left for him, get back up the chimney, jump into the sleigh and get onto the next house. <br /><br><br /><br>Assuming that each of these 108 million stops is evenly distributed around the earth (which, of course, we know to be false, but will accept for the purposes of our calculations), we are not talking about 0.78 miles per household; a total trip of 75.5 million miles, not counting bathroom stops or breaks. <br /><br><br /><br>This means Santa''s sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second - 3,000 times the speed of sound. For purposes of comparison, the fastest man made vehicle, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a pokey 27.4 miles per second, and a conventional reindeer can run (at best) 15 miles per hour. The payload of the sleigh adds another interesting element. Assuming that each child gets nothing more than a medium sized LEGO set (two pounds), the sleigh is carrying over 500 thousand tons, not counting Santa himself. On land, a conventional reindeer can pull no more than 300 pounds. Even granting that flying reindeer can pull 10 times the normal amount, the job can''t be done with eight or even nine of them -Santa would need 360,000 of them. This increases the payload, not counting the weight of the sleigh, another 54,000 tons, or roughly seven times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth (the ship, not the monarch). <br /><br><br /><br>A mass of nearly 600,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air resistance - this would heat up the reindeer in the same fashion as a spacecraft re-entering the earth''s atmosphere. The lead pair of reindeer would absorb 14.3 quintillion joules of energy per second each. In short, they would burst into flames almost instantaneously, exposing the reindeer behind them and creating deafening sonic booms in their wake. The entire reindeer team would be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of a second, or right about the time Santa reaches the fifth house on his trip. Not that it matters, however, since Santa, as a result of accelerating from a dead stop to 650 m.p.s. in .001 seconds, would be subjected to acceleration forces of 17,000 g''s. <br /><br><br /><br>A 250 pound Santa (which seems ludicrously slim considering all the high calorie snacks he must have consumed over the years) would be pinned to the back of the sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of force, instantly crushing his bones and organs and reducing him to a quivering blob of pink goo. Therefore, if Santa did exist, he''s dead now. MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!','Other / Misc',172,'Santa!');
INSERT INTO wocka VALUES ('At the 1994 annual awards dinner given for Forensic Science, AAFS president Dr. Don Harper Mills astounded his audience with the legal complications of a bizarre death. Here is the story: <br /><br>On March 23, 1994, the medical examiner viewed the body of Ronald Opus and concluded that he died from a shotgun wound to the head. The decedent had jumped from the top of a ten-story building intending to commit suicide. <br /><br><br /><br>He left a note to that effect, indicating his despondency. As he fell past the ninth floor, his life was interrupted by a shotgun blast passing through a window, which killed him instantly. Neither the shooter nor the decedent was aware that a safety net had been installed just below at the eighth floor level to protect some building workers and that Ronald Opus would not have been able to complete his suicide the way he had planned. <br /><br><br /><br>Ordinarily, Dr. Mills continued, "a person who sets out to commit suicide and ultimately succeeds, even though the mechanism might not be what he intended", is still defined as committing suicide. Mr. Opus was shot on the way to certain death nine stories below at street level, but his suicide attempt probably would not have been successful because of the safety net. This caused the medical examiner to feel that he had a homicide on his hands. <br /><br><br /><br>The room on the ninth floor from whence the shotgun blast emanated was occupied by an elderly man and his wife. They were arguing vigorously, and he was threatening her with a shotgun. The man was so upset that when he pulled the trigger he completely missed his wife and the pellets went through the window striking Mr. Opus. <br /><br><br /><br>When one intends to kill subject A, but kills subject B in the attempt, one is guilty of the murder of subject B. When confronted with the murder charge, the old man and his wife were both adamant. They both said they thought the shotgun was unloaded. The old man said it was his long standing habit to threaten his wife with the unloaded shotgun. He had no intention to murder her, therefore the killing of Mr. Opus appeared to be an accident; that is, the gun had been accidentally loaded. <br /><br><br /><br>The continuing investigation turned up a witness who saw the old couple''s son loading the shotgun about six weeks prior to the fatal accident. It transpired that the old lady had cut off her son''s financial support and the son, knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun threateningly, loaded the gun with the expectation that his father would shoot his mother. <br /><br><br /><br>The case now becomes one of murder on the part of the son for the death of Ronald Opus. <br /><br><br /><br>Now comes the exquisite twist; further investigation revealed that the son was in fact Ronald Opus. He had become increasingly despondent over both the loss of his financial support and the failure of his attempt to engineer his mother''s murder. This led him to jump off the ten-story building on March 23rd, only to be killed by a shotgun blast passing through the ninth-story window. The son had actually murdered himself, so the medical examiner closed the case as a suicide.','News / Politics',173,'Murder? Or Suicide?');

INSERT INTO wocka VALUES ('GENERAL MOTORS INTRODUCES NEW INSTANT-WIN AIRBAGS DETROIT-- <br /><br><br /><br>With third-quarter sales sluggish and its share of the domestic market down 11 percent since 1993, General Motors unveiled a new instant-win airbag contest Monday. The new airbags, which award fabulous prizes upon violent, high-speed impact with another car or stationary object, will come standard in all of the company''s 1997 cars.<br /><br><br /><br>"Auto accidents have never been so exciting," said GM vice-president of marketing Roger Jenkins, who expects the contest to boost 1997 sales significantly. "When you play the new GM Instant Win Airbag Game, your next fatal collision could mean a trip for two to Super Bowl XXXI in New Orleans. Or a year''s worth of free Mobile gasoline."<br /><br><br /><br>Though it does not officially begin until Jan. 1, 1997, the airbag promotion is already being tested in select cities, with feedback overwhelmingly positive. "As soon as my car started to skid out of control, I thought to myself, ''Oh, boy, this could be it--I could be a big winner!''" said Cincinnati''s Martin Frelks, who lost his wife but won $50 Sunday when the Buick LeSabre they were driving hit an oil slick at 60 mph and slammed into an oncoming truck.<br /><br><br /><br>"When the car stopped rolling down the embankment, I knew Ellen was dead, but all I could think about was getting the blood and glass out of my eyes so I could read that airbag!" <br /><br><br /><br>"It''s really addictive," said Sacramento, CA, resident Marjorie Kamp, speaking from her hospital bed, where she is listed in critical condition with severe brain hemorrhaging and a punctured right lung.<br /><br><br /><br>"I''ve already crashed four cars trying to win those Super Bowl tickets, but I still haven''t won. I swear, I''m going to win those tickets--even if it kills me!" Kamp said that as soon as she is well enough, she plans to buy a new Pontiac Bonneville and drive it into a tree.<br /><br><br /><br>GM officials are not surprised the airbag contest has been so well received. "In the past, nobody really liked car wrecks, and that''s understandable. After all, they''re scary and dangerous and, sometimes, even fatal," GM CEO Paul Offerman said. "But now, when you drive a new GM car or truck, your next serious crash could mean serious cash.<br /><br><br /><br>"Who wouldn''t like that?" Offerman added that in the event a motorist wins a prize but is killed, that prize will be awarded to the next of kin. According to GM''s official contest rules, odds of winning the grand prize, a brand-new 1997 Cutlass Supreme, are 1 in 43,000,000.<br /><br><br /><br>Statistical experts, however, say the real chances of winning are significantly worse. "If you factor in the odds of getting in a serious car accident in the first place--approximately 1 in 720,000--the actual odds of winning a prize each time you step in your car are more like 1 in 31 trillion."<br /><br><br /><br>Further, even if one is in an accident, there is no guarantee the airbag will inflate. "I was recently broadsided by a drunk driver in my new Chevy Cavalier," said Erie, PA, resident Jerry Polaner. "My car was totaled, and because it was the side of my car that got hit, my airbag didn''t even inflate. But what really gets me is the fact that the drunk driver, who rammed my side with the front of his 1997 Buick Regal, won a $100 Office Depot gift certificate. That''s just wrong."','Other / Misc',456,'Car Airbags');

Support your answer with a proof." Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle''s Law (gas cools off when it expands and heats up when it is compressed) or some variant thereof. <br /><br><br /><br>One student, however, wrote the following: <br /><br><br /><br>First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So, we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the rate at which they are leaving. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let''s look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since, there are more than one of these religions, and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all people and all souls go to Hell. <br /><br><br /><br>With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell, because Boyle''s Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand as souls are added. <br /><br><br /><br>This gives two possibilities: <br /><br><br /><br>1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose. <br /><br>2. Of course, if Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over. <br /><br><br /><br>So which is it? <br /><br><br /><br>If we accept the postulate given to me by Ms. Krissy Jones during my Freshman year that "it will be a cold night in Hell before I sleep with you" and take into account the fact that I still have not succeeded in having sexual relations with her, then (2) cannot be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic. <br /><br><br /><br>This student got the only A.','Other / Misc',468,'Theory on Hell');

You see, we''ve never had a Human Resources Director make it this far and we''re not really sure what to do with you."<br /><br>"No problem, just let me in," said the woman.<br /><br>"Well, I''d like to, but I have higher orders. What we are going to do is let you have a day in Hell and a day in Heaven and then you can choose whichever one you want to spend an Eternity in."<br /><br>"Actually, I think I''ve made up my mind. I prefer to stay in Heaven," said the HR Director. <br /><br>"Sorry, we have rules."<br /><br>And with that St. Peter put the HR executive in a lift and down it went to Hell. The doors opened and she found herself stepping onto the putting green of a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club and standing in front of her were all friends and fellow executives she had worked with and they were all cheering for her. They ran up and kissed her on both cheeks and talked about old times. They played an excellent round of golf and at night went to the country club where she enjoyed an excellent steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil who was actually a really nice guy. She had a great time telling jokes and dancing. Everybody shook her hand and waved good-bye as she got in the lift. The elevator opened at the Pearly Gates and she found St. Peter waiting for her. <br /><br>She spent the next 24 hours lounging around on the clouds and playing the harp and singing. She had a great time and before she knew it her 24 hours were up and St. Peter came and got her.<br /><br>"So you have spent a day in hell, and a day in Heaven. Now choose your eternity," he said.<br /><br>The woman replied: "Well I never thought I would say this. I mean, Heaven has been really great and all, but I think I had a better time in Hell."<br /><br>So St. Peter escorted her to the lift and again she went back to Hell. When the doors opened she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in rubbish and filth. She saw her friends were dressed in rags and were picking up the rubbish and putting it in sacks. The Devil came up to her and put his arm around her.<br /><br>"I don''t understand," stammered the HR Director.

INSERT INTO wocka VALUES ('I. Know that although the cat has the advantage of quickness and lack of concern for human life, you have the advantage of strength. Capitalize on that advantage by selecting the battlefield. Don''t try to bathe him in an open area where he can force you to chase him. Pick a very small bathroom. If your bathroom is more than four feet square, I recommend that you get in the tub with the cat and close the sliding -glass doors as if you were about to take a shower. (A simple shower curtain will not do. A berserk cat can shred a three-ply rubber shower curtain quicker than a politician can shift positions.) <br /><br><br /><br>II. Know that a cat has claws and will not hesitate to remove all the skin from your body. Your advantage here is that you are smart and know how to dress to protect yourself. I recommend canvas overalls tucked into high-top construction boots, a pair of steel-mesh gloves, an army helmet, a hockey face-mask, and a long-sleeved flak jacket. <br /><br><br /><br>III. Use the element of surprise. Pick up your cat nonchalantly, as if to simply carry him to his supper dish. (Cats will not usually notice your strange attire. They have little or no interest in fashion as a rule.) <br /><br><br /><br>IV. Once you are inside the bathroom, speed is essential to survival. In a single liquid motion, shut the bathroom door, step into the tub enclosure, slide the glass door shut, dip the cat in the water and squirt him with shampoo. You have begun one of the wildest 45 seconds of your life. <br /><br><br /><br>V. Cats have no handles. Add the fact that he now has soapy fur, and the problem is radically compounded. Do not expect to hold on to him for more than two or three seconds at a time. When you have him, however, you must remember to give him another squirt of shampoo and rub like crazy. He''ll then spring free and fall back into the water, thereby rinsing himself off. (The national record for cats is three latherings, so don''t expect too much.) <br /><br><br /><br>IV. Next, the cat must be dried. Novice cat bathers always assume this part will be the most difficult, for humans generally are worn out at this point and the cat is just getting really determined. In fact, the drying is simple compared with what you have just been through. That''s because by now the cat is semi-permanently affixed to your right leg. You simply pop the drain plug with your foot, reach for your towel and wait. (Occasionally, however, the cat will end up clinging to the top of your army helmet. If this happens, the best thing you can do is to shake him loose and to encourage him toward your leg.) After all the water is drained from the tub, it is a simple matter to just reach down and dry the cat. In a few days the cat will relax enough to be removed from your leg. He will usually have nothing to say for about three weeks and will spend a lot of time sitting with his back to you. He might even become psychoceramic and develop the fixed stare of a plaster figurine. You will be tempted to assume he is angry. This isn''t usually the case. As a rule he is simply plotting ways to get through your defenses and injure you for life the next time you decide to give him a bath. <br /><br><br /><br>But at least now he smells a lot better.','Animal',1338,'How To Bathe A Cat');

INSERT INTO wocka VALUES ('A while back, over in Great Britain, a woman complained to the telephone company about her phone. Sometimes, it would not ring when someone called. <br /><br><br /><br>The strange part, she said, was that when it did ring, the ring was invariably preceded by her dog barking. So she was convinced she had a broken telephone and a psychic dog. <br /><br><br /><br>Now, in Britain, the ring signal is a high-voltage low-ampere current sent from the local office to the phone. The wire which carries this signal is run from the pole to a large metal spike in the yard, which grounds the circuit. <br /><br><br /><br>In order to isolate the problem, the phone company sent a repairman out to climb the pole and manually send the signal down the wire. Sure enough, when he did this, nothing happened the first time. The second time, the dog barked just before the phone rang. <br /><br><br /><br>Investigation revealed that the dog was chained (with an iron chain) to the spike that grounded the circuit. So this is what was happening: the ground was dry, preventing the ring signal from grounding itself easily through the spike, so the current ran down the chain to the dog, paralyzing him. <br /><br><br /><br>When the current released the dog, he yelped and urinated, which wet the ground, so that the second ring signal made it through and the phone rang.','Animal',1763,'Ringing Dog');

Some of the best humor is in the misspelling.<br /><br><br /><br><br /><br>Ancient Egypt was inhabited by mummies and they all wrote in hydraulics. They lived in the Sarah Dessert. The climate of the Sarah is such that all the inhabitants have to live elsewhere.<br /><br><br /><br>Moses led the Hebrew slaves to the Red Sea where they made unleavened read, which is bread made without any ingredients. Moses went up on Mount Cyanide to get the ten commandments. He died before he ever reached Canada.<br /><br><br /><br>Solomon had three hundred wives and seven hundred porcupines.<br /><br><br /><br>The Greeks were a highly sculptured people, and without them we wouldn''t have history. The Greeks also had myths. A myth is a female moth.<br /><br><br /><br>Socrates was a famous Greek teacher who went around giving people advice. They killed him. Socrates died from an overdose of wedlock. After his death, his career suffered a dramatic decline.<br /><br><br /><br>In the Olympic games, Greeks ran races, jumped, hurled biscuits, and threw the java.<br /><br><br /><br>Julius Caesar extinguished himself on the battlefields of Gaul. The Ides of March murdered him because they thought he was going to be made king. Dying, he gasped out: "Tee hee, Brutus."<br /><br><br /><br>Joan of Arc was burnt to a steak and was canonized by Bernard Shaw.<br /><br><br /><br>Queen Elizabeth was the "Virgin Queen." As a queen she was a success. When she exposed herself before her troops they all shouted "hurrah."<br /><br><br /><br>It was an age of great inventions and discoveries. Gutenberg invented removable type and the Bible. Another important invention was the circulation of blood. Sir Walter Raleigh is a historical figure because he invented cigarettes and started smoking. Sir Francis Drake circumsized the world with a 100 foot clipper.<br /><br><br /><br>The greatest writer of the Renaissance was William Shakespeare. He was born in the year 1564, supposedly on his birthday. He never made much money and is famous only because of his plays. He wrote tragedies, comedies, and hysterectomies, all in Islamic pentameter. Romeo and Juliet are an example of a heroic couple. Romeo''s last wish was to be laid by Juliet.<br /><br><br /><br>Writing at the same time as Shakespeare was Miguel Cervantes. He wrote Donkey Hote. The next great author was John Milton. Milton wrote Paradise Lost. Then his wife died and he wrote Paradise Regained.<br /><br><br /><br>Delegates from the original 13 states formed the Contented Congress. Thomas Jefferson, a Virgin, and Benjamin Franklin were two singers of the Declaration of Independence. Franklin discovered electricity by rubbing two cats backward and declared, "A horse divided against itself cannot stand." Franklin died in 1790 and is still dead.<br /><br><br /><br>Abraham Lincoln became America''s greatest Precedent. Lincoln''s mother died in infancy, and he was born in a log cabin which he built with his own hands. Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves by signing the Emasculation Proclamation. On the night of April 14, 1865, Lincoln went to the theater and got shot in his seat by one of the actors in a moving picture show. They believe the assinator was John Wilkes Booth, a supposingly insane actor. This ruined Booth''s career.<br /><br><br /><br>Johann Bach wrote a great many musical compositions and had a large number of children. In between he practiced on an old spinster which he kept up in his attic. Bach died from 1750 to the present. Bach was the most famous composer in the world and so was Handel. Handel was half German, half Italian, and half English. He was very large.<br /><br><br /><br>Beethoven wrote music even though he was deaf. He was so deaf he wrote loud music. He took long walks in the forest even when everyone was calling for him. Beethoven expired in 1827 and later died for this.<br /><br><br /><br>The nineteenth century was a time of a great many thoughts and inventions. People stopped reproducing by hand and started reproducing by machine. The invention of the steamboat caused a network of rivers to spring up. Cyrus McCormick invented the McCormick raper, which did the work of a hundred men. Louis Pasteur discovered a cure for rabbits. Charles Darwin was a naturalist who wrote the Organ of the Species.

INSERT INTO wocka VALUES ('Dear Sir,<br /><br><br /><br>I am writing in response to your request for additional information in Block 3 of the accident report form. I put "poor planning" as the cause of my accident. You asked for a fuller explanation and I trust the following details will be sufficient.<br /><br><br /><br>I am a bricklayer by trade. On the day of the accident, I was working alone on the roof of a new six-story building. When I completed my work, I found that I had some bricks left over which, when weighed later were found to be slightly in excess of 500lbs. Rather than carry the bricks down by hand, I decided to lower them in a barrel by using a pulley, which was attached to the side of the building on the sixth floor.<br /><br><br /><br>Securing the rope to the ground I went up to the roof, swung the barrel out and loaded the bricks into it. Then I went down and untied the rope, holding it tightly to ensure a slow descent of the bricks.<br /><br><br /><br>You will note in Block 11 of the accident report form that I weigh 135 lbs.<br /><br><br /><br>Due to my surprise at being jerked off the ground so suddenly, I lost my presence of mind and forgot to let go of the rope. Needless to say, I proceeded at a rapid rate up the side of the building.<br /><br><br /><br>In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel, which was now proceeding downward at an equally impressive speed. This explained the fractured skull, minor abrasions and the broken collar bone, as listed in Section 3 of the accident report form. I slowed only slightly, I continued my rapid ascent, not stopping until the fingers of my right hand were two knuckles deep into the pulley. Fortunately by this time I had regained my presence of mind and was able to hold tightly to the rope, in spite of beginning to experience pain.<br /><br><br /><br>At approximately the same time, however, the barrel of bricks hit the ground and the bottom fell out of the barrel. Now devoid of the weight of the bricks, that barrel weighed approximately 50 lbs. I refer you again to my weight. As you can imagine, I began a rapid descent, down the side of the building.<br /><br><br /><br>In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel coming up. This accounts for the two fractured ankles, broken tooth and several lacerations of my legs and lower body. Here my luck began to change slightly. The encounter with the barrel seemed to slow me enough to lessen my injuries when I fell into the pile of bricks and fortunately only three vertebrae were cracked. I am sorry to report, however, as I lay there on the pile of bricks, in pain, unable to move, I again lost my composure and presence of mind and let go of the rope and I lay there watching the empty barrel begin its journey back down onto me. This explains the two broken legs. I hope this answers your inquiry.','At Work',3238,'The Brick Layer');

She just couldn''t bring herself to write the word "toilet" in her letter. After much deliberation, she finally came up the the old-fashioned term "bathroom commode".

I placed the patient twenty feet from the chart and began, "Cover your right eye with your hand." He read the 20/20 line perfectly. "Now your left." Again, a flawless read. "Now both," I requested. There was silence. He couldn''t even read the large E on the top line. I turned and discovered that he had done exactly what I had asked; he was standing there with both his eyes covered. I was laughing too hard to finish the exam.<br /><br>**<br /><br>During a patient''s two week follow-up appointment with his cardiologist, he informed his doctor that he was having trouble with one of his medications. "Which one?" asked the doctor. "The patch. The nurse told me to put on a new one every six hours and now I''m running out of places to put it!" The doctor had him quickly undress and discovered what he hoped he wouldn''t see... Yes, the man had over fifty patches on his body! Now the instructions include removal of the old patch before applying a new one.<br /><br>**<br /><br>While acquainting myself with a new elderly patient, I asked, "How long have you been bedridden?" After a look of complete confusion she answered.... ...."Why, not for about twenty years - when my husband was alive."<br /><br>**<br /><br>I was caring for a woman from Kentucky and asked, "So how''s your breakfast this morning?" "It''s very good, except for the Kentucky Jelly. I can''t seem to get used to the taste," the patient replied. I then asked to see the jelly and the woman produced a foil packet labeled "KY Jelly."','Medical',3427,'Doctor Stories: Truth Defeats Fiction');

No cards, no flowers, no special nights on the town-the name of the holiday explains it all...just a steak and a BJ. That''s it.<br /><br><br /><br>This twin pairing of Valentine''s Day and Steak & Blowjob Day will usher in a new age of love as men everywhere will try THAT much harder in February to ensure a more memorable March! It''s like a perpetual love machine.<br /><br><br /><br>The word is already spreading, but as with any new idea, it needs a little push to start the ball rolling.

It is strictly for your edification and enjoyment. <br /><br><br /><br>Before the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, the French, anticipating victory over the English, proposed to cut off the middle finger of all captured English soldiers. Without their middle finger, it would be impossible to draw the renowned English longbow and therefore they would be incapable of fighting in the future. <br /><br><br /><br>The longbow was a famous weapon. It was made of the native English Yew tree, and the act of drawing the longbow was known as "plucking the yew." <br /><br><br /><br>Much to the bewilderment of the French, the English won a major upset and began mocking the French by waving their middle fingers at the defeated French, saying, "See, we can still pluck yew! PLUCK YEW!" <br /><br><br /><br>Over the years, some ''folk etymologies'' have grown up around this symbolic gesture. Since ''pluck yew'' is rather difficult to say (like "pleasant mother pheasant plucker", which is who you had to go to for the feathers used on the arrows for the longbow), the difficult consonant cluster at the beginning has gradually changed to a labiodental fricative ''F'', and thus the words often used in conjunction with the one-finger-salute are mistakenly thought to have something to do with an intimate encounter. <br /><br><br /><br>It is also because of the pheasant feathers on the arrows that the symbolic gesture is known as "giving the bird". <br /><br><br /><br>Are you not thrilled that you have someone out there that will send you educational stuff like this? <br /><br><br /><br>History repeats itself - Once again the appropriate message was given to the French!','Other / Misc',3898,'The Historical Origin Of "The Finger"');

Infertile couples and old people can''t legally get married because the world needs more children.<br /><br><br /><br>3. Obviously gay parents will raise gay children, since straight parents only raise straight children. <br /><br><br /><br>4. Gay marriage will be less meaningful, since Britney Spears'' 55-hour just-for-fun marriage was meaningful.<br /><br><br /><br>5. Heterosexual marriage has been around a long time and hasn''t changed at all; women are property, blacks can''t marry whites, and divorce is illegal.<br /><br><br /><br>6. Gay marriage should be decided by people not the courts, because the majority-elected legislatures, not courts, have historically protected the rights of the minorities.<br /><br><br /><br>7. Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours, the values of one religion are imposed on the entire country. That''s why we have only one religion in America.<br /><br><br /><br>8. Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall.<br /><br><br /><br>9. Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage contract.<br /><br><br /><br>10. Children can never succeed without a male and a female role model at home. That''s why single parents are forbidden to raise children.<br /><br><br /><br>11. Gay marriage will change the foundation of society. Heterosexual marriage has been around for a long time, and we could never adapt to new social norms because we haven''t adapted to cars or longer life spans.<br /><br><br /><br>12. Civil unions, providing most of the same benefits as marriage with a different name are better, because a "separate but equal" institution is always constitutional.
